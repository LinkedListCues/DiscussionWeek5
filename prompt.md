A _binary search tree_ is a binary tree that 

## Worksheet

You've been given a `BST` class for making binary trees that store integers. Implement the `static` methods
`Maximum`, `Minimum`, `Contains`, and `Valid`. For this class. Unit tests have been provided for you for all four.

## Microquiz

1. Which order traversal prints the elements of a binary search tree from least to greatest? (2 words, if you don't
hyphenate)

2. What is the worst case time complexity for minimum, maximum, insertion, deletion, and search of a binary search
tree? What about a _balanced_ binary tree? (20 words max.)

3. For checking that the binary search tree property is held by a given tree, why is it inadequate to simply check
if each node's children are less than/greater than the node itself? (10 words max.)

_Once you've submitted your microquiz at the link provided you, you're good to go._
